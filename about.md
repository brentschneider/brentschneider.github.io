  <h1>Hello,</h1>
</section>

### I’m Brent Schneider, designer, developer and I like solving problems.

Founder of Milkshake Interactive, volunteer Director of Inland Northwest Technologists (INT), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and works in higher education. where I’ve honed my craft further as an 'intrapreneur', bringing new services online, empowering the teams I work with all the while focusing on uncovering the needs of the user in order to deliver the best possible experience online.

### Our tools & technologies are rapidly changing, but at its core this is my technology stack;

~~~
  • Frameworks • Modernizr • Javascript • HTML • CSS • JQuery
  • Github • Git • Ruby • Sass • Azure • Bitbucket • Amazon Web Services
  • Cloudflare • WordPress • Jekyll • Google Apps • Sublime • Atom
  • Adobe CC • Invision • Sketch
~~~


When not designing, I have an insatiable hunger to learn and advance my craft, I thrive in fast-paced, high energy environments, where quick thinking and laughing is encouraged.

Also I love volunteering in the community, check out our [INT events on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InlandNorthwestTechnologists/events).
