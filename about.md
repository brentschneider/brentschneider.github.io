  <h1>Hello,</h1>
</section>

### I’m Brent Schneider, designer, developer and I like solving problems.

Founder of Milkshake Interactive and volunteer Director of Inland Northwest Technologists (INT), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Over the past seven years I’ve been working in higher education where I’ve honed my craft further as an 'intrapreneur', bringing new services online, empowering the teams I work with all the while focusing on uncovering the needs of the user in order to deliver the best possible experience.

### Our tools & technologies are rapidly changing, but at its core this is my technology stack;

~~~
  • Frameworks • Modernizr • Javascript • HTML • CSS • JQuery
  • Github • Git • Ruby • Sass • Azure • Bitbucket • Amazon Web Services
  • Cloudflare • WordPress • Jekyll • Google Apps • Sublime
  • Adobe CC • Atom • Responsive/Adaptive Design.
  • Develops brand identities for corporate, nonprofit, & government sectors.
~~~

When not designing, I have an insatiable hunger to learn and advance my craft, I thrive in fast-paced, high energy environments, where quick thinking and laughing is encouraged. Whether it's in the office or after hours, I love to conspire with industry colleagues check out our [INT events on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InlandNorthwestTechnologists/events).
