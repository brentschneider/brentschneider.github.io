## Hello,

I’m Brent Schneider, managing Founder of Milkshake Interactive & maker of fine things that live on the web.


I bring fifteen years of front end design/development and marketing experience to the table.  When I am not working hard to make sure my clients are getting the best service, I enjoy spending time creating art, crafting fine coffee or exploring the Pacific Northwest, which I call home, Spokane Wa, specifically.

I have an insatiable hunger to learn and advance my craft, I thrive in fast-paced, high energy environments, where quick thinking and an infectious laugh is encouraged. Whether it's in the office or after hours, I love to conspire on fresh ideas and share with industry colleagues.

Our tools & technologies are rapidly changing, but at its core this is my technology stack;

~~~
  • Frameworks • Modernizr • Javascript • HTML • CSS • JQuery
  • Github • Git • Ruby • Sass • Azure • Bitbucket • Amazon Web Services
  • Cloudflare • WordPress • Jekyll • Google Apps • Sublime
  • Adobe CC • Atom • Responsive/Adaptive Design.
~~~

In addition to the work I do as a thought leader and interaction designer for the past five years I’ve been working in higher-education where I’ve honed my craft further as an 'intrapreneur', bringing new services online, empowering the teams I work with all while focusing on uncovering the needs of the user in order to deliver the best possible user experience.

When it comes down to it, I love sharing my passion with others, helping people learn and I take pride in providing great work for my client's. Thanks for your time, feel free to contct [@webmedic](http://twitter.com/webmedic) or email  __{{ site.email }}__...
