# A mobile first approach to campus dining app


Our team at Eastern started a mobile app science experiment. The winning idea was building a mobile first app that highlighted dining service locations on campus..  

For the first release, I focused on designing the user experience around finding individual campus dining locations.

In coming iterations the app will connect to facebook pages, search menu items, (a feature we discovered needed organizational standards to be determined before we can implement) and at some point in the future, link to ordering food online.


##The welcome splash screen

##Next, choose a location;

##The individual location.
{% include image.html url="/media/2014-07-26-Designing-clean-apps/LocationDetailsScreen.png" width="320px" description="In this view the current time and day is displayed, accepted payment types and foods offered" %}

##Just tap to view location on the map.
