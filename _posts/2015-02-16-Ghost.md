###Key differences between Ghost and WordPress:

1. Non-Profit vs For Profit:
2. Type of Open-Source: WordPress uses the GNU or General Public License, Ghost is MIT open source license
3. Node.js vs PHP

Using a modern web framework, ghost is not only light weight and robust but fairly simple to get set up and running within a matter of hours.

First, setup your [Amazon Web Services EC2 instance](
http://www.howtoinstallghost.com/how-to-setup-an-amazon-ec2-instance-to-host-ghost-for-free/)

###AWS Console:
Create instance - download key

```
sudo chmod 600 /path/to/amazon.pem

start instance
r+click connect

ssh -i /path/to/amazon/awskey.pem ec2-user@[public-dns]
```



###Install Ghost

Update the operating system:

```
sudo yum update
```

Install C compiler

```
sudo yum install gcc
sudo yum install gcc-c++ compat-gcc-32 compat-gcc-32-c++
```
Install node.js

```
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf node-latest.tar.gz
cd node-directory
```

Use the following commands to compile and install node.js

```
./configure  
make  
sudo make install
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node-waf /usr/bin/node-waf
```

Download and install Ghost

```
mkdir -p /var/www/
cd /var/www/
wget https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip
unzip -d ghost [Ghost file you downloaded]
cd ghost/
sudo /usr/local/bin/npm install --production
```

Configure and start Ghost

```
sudo vim config.example.js
```

Under the "Default Configuration" section

```
change "host:" 0.0.0.0
change "port:" to port 80
```



##Create Ghost User

```
useradd ghost
sudo passwd ghost
```

Create a password

```
chown -R ghost:ghost /var/www/ghost/
```

Now to start Ghost, you will need to log into your "ghost" user.

```
su - ghost
cd /var/www/ghost/
```

Now that you are logged in with your "ghost" user you can start Ghost:

```
npm start --production
```

Now go to your amazon URL and Ghost is up! Go to yoururl.com/ghost/ to setup your admin user and you have a free Ghost install!

Possible Errors: 1. Permissions 0777 for '/Documents/AmazonKey.pem' are too open. It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others. This private key will be ignored.

```
sudo chmod 600 ~/Documents/AmazonKey.pem
```
